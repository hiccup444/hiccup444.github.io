The most preferred way to publish PEAK mods is through [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/), where the community also hangs out.

Before uploading your mod, you need to have built it into a `.dll`.


## Packaging With TCLI

The [PEAK BepInEx Template](<https://github.com/PEAKModding/BepInExTemplate>) comes with Thunderstore packaging built-in, using [TCLI](<https://github.com/thunderstore-io/thunderstore-cli>).

If you used the template, you can build Thunderstore packages by running:
```sh
dotnet build -c Release -target:PackTS -v d
```

:::note
You can learn about different build options with `dotnet build --help`.  
`-c` is short for `--configuration` and `-v d` is `--verbosity detailed`.
:::

The built package will be found at `artifacts/thunderstore/`.

Once you have the ZIP package, you can jump straight into [Uploading to Thunderstore](#uploading-to-thunderstore)!

## Manual Packaging

Create a new folder. Here we want to create a few files and one folder.  
Your new mod folder should look like this:

<FileTree>
- LICENSE (optional)
- manifest.json
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- icon.png
- plugins
  - com.github.YourAccount.YourMod.dll
</FileTree>

### `manifest.json`

Your manifest is crucial — without it, your mod won't work on Thunderstore.

Here’s an example of what it should look like:

```json title="manifest.json"
{
  "name": "Your_mod_name",
  "version_number": "1.0.0",
  "website_url": "https://peakmodding.github.io",
  "description": "A mod description",
  "dependencies": []
}
```

The manifest is fragile. Use this tool to validate it:  
[Thunderstore Manifest Validator](https://thunderstore.io/tools/manifest-v1-validator/)

**Notes:**
- Underscores in `name` will appear as spaces on the site.
- `version_number` must increase with every release.
- `website_url` is optional, but linking your GitHub page is recommended.
- You can include any number of dependencies.

**Example with dependencies:**

```json title="manifest.json"
{
  ...
  "dependencies": [
    "MonoDetour-MonoDetour_BepInEx_5-0.6.6",
    "MonoDetour-MonoDetour-0.6.6"
  ]
}
```

Dependency strings can be found on the individual mod’s page on Thunderstore.

### `README.md` & `CHANGELOG.md`

- `README.md` becomes your mod’s description on Thunderstore.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is optional, but useful for showing update history.

Both files support Markdown formatting. Example:

<details>
<summary> Amazing feature 1 </summary>

- This is an amazing feature for only the best.

</details>

```
Amazing feature 2
```

### `icon.png`

Your icon must be exactly **256x256** pixels.

### LICENSE

Choosing a license can feel overwhelming, but here’s a simple guide:

1. **Do you want others to use your code in their mods?**
2. **Do you want credit for your work?**
3. **Do you care if others use it in commercial/closed-source projects?**

Common license options:

- **MIT License** — Very permissive. Others can reuse your code with attribution, even commercially.
- **GPL-3.0** — Requires others to also open-source their projects if they use your code.
- **CC0 / Unlicense** — No rights reserved. Anyone can use your code however they want, no credit needed.

Generate one here: [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)

:::tip
If you're unsure, **MIT** is a safe and popular choice for mods.
:::

:::danger
Not including a LICENSE file means your mod defaults to **All Rights Reserved** — others cannot legally use, share, or remix it.
:::

### Making a ZIP

Now zip up your contents.

**Do NOT zip the folder itself.**  
Instead, select all files inside and compress them.

On Windows:
- Select all files
- Right-click → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder

## Uploading to Thunderstore

To upload a mod, first create a Thunderstore team by logging in and going here:  
https://thunderstore.io/settings/teams/create/

:::tip
Once a mod is uploaded, your Thunderstore team **cannot** be deleted or renamed — choose carefully!
:::

Then go to: [Thunderstore Upload Page](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/create/)

- Upload your `.zip`
- Select your team
- Choose **PEAK** as the community
- Select relevant categories
- Submit!

If your mod is NSFW, make sure to mark it.

:::caution
Uploaded packages can not be deleted, but they can be deprecated which will hide the package. To fully delete a package, you must reach out to Thunderstore staff.
:::
:::danger
Skipping steps can cause your mod upload to fail.  
If it's rejected by moderation, visit the `#rejected-uploads` channel in the Discord server to appeal.

## Get the Modder Role

Want that shiny **Modder** role in the [PEAK Modding server](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB)?

Just do the following:
- Join the server
- Go to `#mod-releases`
- Post your mod
- Wait for the role to be assigned (if applicable)
