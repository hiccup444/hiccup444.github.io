You have published your mod, great! But now you want to update it, but it's not obvious how to do so.

To update your mod, you need to simply change the version number in the Thunderstore package and upload the package, and it will be uploaded as a new version.

## Updating Version (TCLI)

If you used the [PEAK Modding BepInEx Template](<https://github.com/PEAKModding/BepInExTemplate>), you can update the `Version` property in your `csproj` file:

```xml title="csproj" {7} del="1.0.0" ins="1.1.0"
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.1</TargetFramework>
    <AssemblyName>com.github.YourAccount.ModName</AssemblyName>
    <AssemblyTitle>ModName</AssemblyTitle>
    <Version>1.0.01.1.0</Version>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ...
</Project>

```

This property is used in the template when calling [TCLI](<https://github.com/thunderstore-io/thunderstore-cli>) to build or publish the package so the package always gets the correct version:

```xml title="Directory.Build.targets" "Version"
<Project>
  ...
  <Target Name="PackTS" ...>
    ...
    <Exec Command="dotnet tcli $(BuildArgument) --package-version $(Version)" />
  </Target>
</Project>
```

## Updating Version Manually

Edit your `manifest.json` file and change the version number:

```json title="manifest.json" {3} del="1.0.0" ins="1.1.0"
{
  "name": "Your_mod_name",
  "version_number": "1.0.01.1.0",
  "website_url": "https://peakmodding.github.io",
  "description": "A mod description",
  "dependencies": []
}
```

Then, rezip the mod like before and upload it! Super duper simple!

:::caution
The mod must be under the same community and team! You do not need to fill in the tags.
