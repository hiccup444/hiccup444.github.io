Creating a mod for PEAK is simple using the official BepInEx template. This guide covers installing the template, generating a project, and configuring it for development.

## Installing

.NET templates must be installed before they can be used. This means that when you install the template, it doesn't create a new project for you, but you will get the ability to do that.

Once you have the template installed, you don't need to install it again, through it's a good idea to update it if there are updates.

:::caution
You must use .NET SDK 8 or newer. Older versions are unsupported.
:::

### From NuGet (Recommended)


Install the template by running:

```bash
dotnet new install PEAKModding.BepInExTemplate
```

### Manual Install

If you're contributing to the template or prefer manual installation:

1. Clone or download [this repository](<https://github.com/PEAKModding/BepInExTemplate>)
2. Open a terminal in the root of the project
3. Run:

```bash
dotnet new install .
```

To update:

```bash
dotnet new install . --force
```

To uninstall:

```bash
dotnet new uninstall .
```

Once installed, the template will be available as `PEAK BepInEx Plugin` with an alias `peakmod`.

## Creating a New Mod

Run the following command in your PEAK modding directory:

:::note
You should set up a Thunderstore team first so you can use its name in the `--ts-team` argument so the template can give you a mostly correctly configured packaging setup.

Create your Thunderstore team here: https://thunderstore.io/settings/teams/create/
:::

```bash
dotnet new peakmod --name ModName --guid com.github.YourAccount.ModName --ts-team YourThunderstoreTeam
```

This will create a new folder called `ModName` with your mod's project.

:::tip
If you are developing a public API, add the `--library` option for included NuGet metadata!
:::
:::tip
Use `--no-tutorial` to get rid of tutorial comments in the template. Note that this doesn't get rid of *all* comments.
:::

## Project Structure

This example demonstrates the structure of the project after using the template:

```bash
~/Workspace/PEAK$ dotnet new peakmod --name PeakMod --guid com.github.PEAKModding --ts-team PEAKModding
The template "PEAK BepInEx Plugin" was created successfully.

~/Workspace/PEAK$ cd PeakMod/
```

The file structure in `PeakMod/` should look like this:

<FileTree>
- CHANGELOG.md
- Config.Build.user.props.template
- Directory.Build.props
- Directory.Build.targets
- icon.png
- LICENSE
- PeakMod.sln
- README.md
- src
  - PeakMod
    - PeakMod.csproj
    - Plugin.cs
    - thunderstore.toml
</FileTree>

Key points:

- Your mod code is in `./src/<project-name>/`
- `Directory.Build.*` files define shared build configuration
- `<project-name>.sln` is your project solution

The project is configured so that it's easy to add new projects into your project solution. Even if you don't need that, it's good to follow this standard project structure.

### Setting Up The Config File

At the root of your new project you should see a file named `Config.Build.user.props.template`. This is a special file that is the template for the project's user-specific config. Make a copy of this file and rename it `Config.Build.user.props` without the template part.

This file will copy your assembly files to a plugins directory and it can be used to configure your paths to the game files and BepInEx plugins directory if the defaults don't work for you.

### Thunderstore Packaging

This template comes with Thunderstore packaging built-in, using [Thunderstore CLI](<https://github.com/thunderstore-io/thunderstore-cli>), aka TCLI. You should configure the `src/<project-name>/thunderstore.toml` file for your mod, such as setting the description for your mod.

You can build Thunderstore packages by running:

```sh
dotnet build -c Release -target:PackTS -v d
```

:::note
You can learn about different build options with `dotnet build --help`.  
`-c` is short for `--configuration` and `-v d` is `--verbosity detailed`.
:::

The built package will be found at `artifacts/thunderstore/`.

You can also directly publish to Thunderstore by including `-property:PublishTS=true` in the command.

:::note
For publishing to Thunderstore, you need a Thunderstore API token. The publishing to Thunderstore option is intended to be used via automated GitHub actions workflows, so you don't need to worry about it.
